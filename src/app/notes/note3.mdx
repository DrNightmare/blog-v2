Just got back from an amazing trip to Arunachal Pradesh. Decided to map out the places I've visited so far — turns out I’ve only seen 2.3% of the world! At this pace, hitting even 10% in my lifetime would be a stretch. Time to step it up and explore faster!

[Visited places](https://visitedplaces.com/view/?map=world&projection=geoOrthographic&theme=dark-green&water=1&graticule=0&names=1&duration=2000&placeduration=100&slider=0&autoplay=1&autozoom=none&autostep=1&home=IN&places=My%20Home~IN~1_0_0_-79.5_-22.8*Asia~VN~1.5_83.8_33.3_-83.8_-33.3*Europe~NO_DK_SE_FI~2.4_12.1_53.3_-12.1_-53.3)

Maybe I will set up my own travel tracking page someday, will think about it.
