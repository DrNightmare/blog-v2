Saw some random promoted post on Reddit - turns out it was a geography game, something very similar to what I thought I would build. It was actually pretty good. Basically, you get a country or area to find on a world map and have to click the right spot. Multiple quizzes, works well.

So yeah, no point in reinventing the wheel here. Maybe something India-specific would be interesting instead? Will think about it.
