Just got back from an incredible trip to Kenya—easily some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've ever seen. Interestingly, much of what we now recognize as Kenya was shaped by the volcanic eruption of Mount Kenya, which explains its vast, flat terrain.

We didn’t visit during the Great Migration, but that didn’t stop us from spotting the Big Five, Small Five, and even the Ugly Five. Also, a pride of FOURTEEN LIONS!

This also means I can update my [visited places](https://visitedplaces.com/view/?map=world&projection=geoOrthographic&theme=dark-green&water=1&graticule=0&names=1&duration=2000&placeduration=100&slider=0&autoplay=1&autozoom=none&autostep=1&home=IN&places=My%20Home~IN~1_0_0_-79.5_-22.8*Asia%202023~VN~1.5_83.8_33.3_-83.8_-33.3*Europe%202024~NO_DK_SE_FI~2.4_12.1_53.3_-12.1_-53.3*Africa%202025~KE~1.5_18_1.6_-18_-1.6), which takes my country coverage to 2.7%!
