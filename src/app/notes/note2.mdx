Went ahead and built a simple prototype of the world map game I wrote about earlier; however, decided for some reason that it would be a good exercise to do it in Godot, so I did that. Currently, there is a world map and a text box that can be used to input guesses, and there is a crude "study" mode to help learn the names of countries when you however over them. Lots of scope for improvement, but it's a good first cut.

While I was at this, TIL: there is a portion of France present in South America, sharing borders with Brazil for some reason? Need to dig deeper into this.
