I took a random test on Sporcle on countries of the world, and I realized just how bad at Geography I am. I want to be able to find any country on a world map. I might set out on building a little browser game to label countries. There could be multiple modes: click on the right location for a given country, or type out the name of the country in a given location. I could even add capitals, this could have so many possibilities to branch out and become an educational tool.
