Got to try out Google's Antigravity editor, and it genuinely feels like the future. I was able to build features across multiple projects in a matter of hours, something that would have easily taken me a month or two not long back. All the while, I also learnt so many new things and only needed to review the high level code, which was an amazing experience.

Here are some of the things I built in the last few days:
- [Atlas](https://github.com/DrNightmare/Project-Atlas), a mobile app for storing and managing travel documents. It is open source, and there are some features I am particularly proud of.
- A full revamp of this blog. Cleaner design, dark mode, color palette chooser and other improvements.
- A Godot 2D platformer POC. It's a work in progress, more updates coming soon.
- A small local app where I write a note for my wife every day

It's wild that this much is possible in such a short time, and wilder to think that this is just the beginning. Tools like this are only going to get better. Excited to see what the future holds!
