<p>I’m a software engineer who genuinely enjoys solving complex problems and building things that work elegantly.</p>
<p>Beyond work, I'm captivated by the intersection of art and coding. I love creating mini-projects that blend computer science with creative domains, allowing me to explore how technology can enhance artistic expression in new ways.</p>
<p>This curiosity naturally extends to video games, which I see as a unique blend of art, code, and design. Games today are not only building believable models of the real world but also tapping into human psychology to create immersive experiences, something I find incredibly fascinating. Playing games for me is both enjoyment and study, as I explore the techniques and mechanics behind the scenes.</p>
<p>For balance, I stay active by playing badminton and football. I trained in badminton for a couple of years, took a short break, but plan to get back into it soon.</p>
<p>Reading is another passion. While I mostly read online articles, I make it a point to read a bit each night on my Kindle. I also have a collection of physical books, some read, some waiting in line. Here's [my library](/library).</p>
<p>I'm also trying my hand at running [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ArvindPrakash94), where I've posted live streams and coding videos.</p>
